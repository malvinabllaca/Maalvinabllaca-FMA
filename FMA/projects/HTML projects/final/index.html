            <p><b>I am Malvina Bllaca. I'm a 14 year old kid with big dreams.</b> I follow my studies in Hello Academy of Education <br>I'm in 9th grade, so basically is my last year in this school. So as a person i have so mny goals that I want to achieve and accomplish in the future. <br>
As a teenager, the part-time job that would be perfect for me is working online in high school, because I have to balance my responsibilities: school and work.
<br>The reason why I want to work online is to experience work life as a young teenager and start earning my own money. <br>So you're probably thinking that I want to earn money and spend them on: clothes, jewerly,makeup just like a basic teen. <br>For me is all different.
I want to learn how to be independent at a very young age, knowing the worth of money, being logic on how to spend it (not trying to use them for unneccary things),judge cold by being mature in some situationships where I have to think fast and correct, so basically be resourcefulness. <br>
If my first goal is accomplished, the money that I would earn, is going to be saved for my dream profession in the future, and I don't care how many years or decades it would take.
- I want to be a <em>cardiolog( heart surgeon) or neurolog( brain surgeon)</em> when I grow up. <br> I find science really intresting especially the anatomy of human.
Being a surgeon is not easy. It is very difficult not just because surgeons interfer to these organs to try and reduct or disappear a sickness. <br>
The main reason is help others, make a person smile and make it forgetable the sickness of him/her. <br>I would feel emotionally veryy good. <br>
In personality I am a introvert person with people who don't bring me a positive energy or peace, but a very communicative and extrovert person with the right ones for myself. <br>
- My parents decribe me as a: smart girl, mature that is a flex in this generation, an overthinker in the positive way, ambitious, confident(not extreme)and friendly. <br>
Everything that I hope I can accomplish in the future is all thanks to my parents support, sacrifices and the courage of them pushing me to achieve my dream.
This is me in a short description.&#128513; </p>
