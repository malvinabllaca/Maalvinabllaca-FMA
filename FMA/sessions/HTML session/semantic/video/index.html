                <p><strong>Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other
                    open-source software, designed primarily</strong> for touchscreen-based mobile devices such as smartphones
                    and tablets. Android has historically been developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open
                    Handset <em>Alliance, but its most widely</em> used version is primarily developed by Google. First released
                    in 2008, Android is the world's most widely used operating system; the latest version, released on
                    October 15, 2024, is Android 15.[4]</p>

                <p>At its core, the operating system is known as the Android Open Source Project (AOSP)[5] and is free
                    and open-source software (FOSS) primarily licensed under the Apache License. However, most devices
                    run the proprietary Android version developed by Google, which ships with additional proprietary
                    closed-source software pre-installed,[6] most notably Google Mobile Services (GMS),[7] which
                    includes core apps such as Google Chrome, the digital distribution platform Google Play, and the
                    associated Google Play Services development platform. Firebase Cloud Messaging is used for push
                    notifications. While AOSP is free, the "Android" name and logo are trademarks of Google, who
                    restrict the use of Android branding on "uncertified" products.</p>
