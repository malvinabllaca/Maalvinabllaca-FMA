            <h2>Project 2</h2>
            <p>A property description is the written portion of a real estate listing that describes the details of a home for sale or lease. Descriptions account for roughly one-third of a listing and are accompanied by property information (i.e. the number of bedrooms) and photographs. The goal of a creative property description is to attract home buyers. Listing descriptions need colorful words to paint a clear mental picture of a home’s features and benefits, over and above the accompanying photographs. Therefore, first-rate copywriting is a must when selling a home.</p>

            <h3>Project 3</h3>
            <p>The Department of Cardiology started working in 1978. The first head of department was Prim. dr Petar Pejčić. As a result of the development of the Institute, the Clinic for Cardiology was established in 1993 under the management of prof. dr Milutin Mirić. Due to the continuous expansion in the scope and complexity of work, in the years that followed the organizational structure of the Clinic became more complex. In the previous period, the duty of the head of the Clinic was performed by prof. dr Aleksandar Nešković, dr sci. med. Lazar Angelkov and prof. Dr. Ljiljana Jovović.</p>
