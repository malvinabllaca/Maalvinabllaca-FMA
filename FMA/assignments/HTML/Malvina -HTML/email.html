<h1>Malvina Bllaca</h1>
<p><em>Hi.! My I’m Malvina and I’m 14 years old. My dream is to be a cardiolog or a neurolog in the future</em>, because I really find myself passionate about studying the human brain or heart.<strong> I want to use codes or programming to know how to work online as my first part-time job.</strong> I want to do digital marketing, sell my own products online by doing partnerships or do business with them, and use this money to follow my dream.
